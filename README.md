Smešno: [funny](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=en&text=Sme%C5%A1no).

Stitch your funnies together for the ultimate lulz.

Given a set of images and videos combine them into a single video meant to be played fullscreen on a loop (no sound in the outcome video).

All files are resized to the same size and the quality is not particularly high. This is done on purpose, it gives the final output that extra level of cheesiness.
